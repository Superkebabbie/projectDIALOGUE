# Welcome

Hello and welcome to the Project Dialogue website. 

This is the official release page of the dynamic, interactive, minecraft dialogue generator: Project Dialogue.

# Tutorials

There is the [basic tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b85h_ujZ_vg) that can help you get started if you are not very experienced with XML. There is also a [advanced tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JUN9aDxVmI) if you already have some experience and want to get down on the dirty details of all features that Project Dialogue has to offer. 
We also have [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Superkebabbie/projectDIALOGUE/wiki) available that contains some detailed documentation. <!--- what kind of documentation? --->
